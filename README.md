# 01-code-refactor
FIrst homework assignment. Divs cleaned up and organized, as well as consolidated (and corrected) CSS.

First off, everything was using the <div> tag which works but is very vague for the browser to read, resulting in poor SEO.
  Header and footer were added to top and bottom.
  
  1. Title was replaced from "Website" to "Digital Marketing Solutions"
  2. Nav bar added
  
  <-- For main content -->
    1. Divs were replaced with 
    
    <section>
      <article>
        
        instead of 
        
        <div>
          <div>
            
 Header class can actually be removed now since its an official tag but... tags cleaned up.          
 Repetitive CSS has been consolidated.
